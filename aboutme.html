 <h1>About Me: The Awesome Girl Who Codes!</h1>
<p>My name is Nevaeh. I like computer science. I like to code because when I grow up I want to work for the FBI and helped them catch the bad guys with my coding skills.<br>
 <p> My brithday is Octeber twenty-fourth. Which makes me a Scorpio. I have a dog named Penelope. She is half Rat-Terrior and Shih Tzu. She takes my stuff and chews on everything, but you can't get mad at her. She's too cute.</p>
<p> I live with my mom and grandma. My mom is a highschool science teacher and my grandma is a retired transit worker. My mom and grandma inspired me to do well in the world and be better than them. When I told my mom I wanted to code, my mom made sure she knew everything about coding. My mom saw how much I love video games and making music and drawing that she put me in the Girls Who Code program over the summer.</p>
